### About me

Previously, I worked in the banking sector in the sales department of banking products. Since 2022, I have been working as a business analyst in the IT department. Currently, I am studying to become a neural network and Python developer. You can check out my projects below. I have experience using the TensorFlow and PyTorch frameworks. I also have experience using the NumPy, Pandas, and SkLearn libraries for data analysis and preprocessing.
I have a higher education. International Academy of Tourism

### PET projects
----------------------------------------------------
### Uploading-a-photo-and-captions-to-it
In this work, we use kagglehub to download the Flickr8k dataset, which contains images and their descriptions. A pre-trained ResNet50 model is used to extract image features and the Seq2Seq model. [Link to the project](https://github.com/deberdeev/Uploading-a-photo-and-captions-to-it)

***Stack:*** Python, tensorflow, keras 

----------------------------------------------------
### Neuro Assistant
Developed a neuro-assistant that provides information about the IT  [Link to the project](https://github.com/deberdeev/Neuropresponder) 

***Stack:*** Python, OpenAI

----------------------------------------------------
### Bot-weather-forecast
This is a weather forecast bot. Write the name of the city to the bot and it will tell you what the temperature is there and how it feels. He will also provide a forecast for the next 7 days! [Link to the project](https://github.com/deberdeev/Bot-weather-forecast)

***Stack:*** Python

----------------------------------------------------
### tg-bot-quiz
Telegram bot based on a 10-question quiz game. Questions about the Python programming language [Link to the project](https://github.com/deberdeev/TG-Bot)

***Stack:*** Python

----------------------------------------------------
### Optimization-of-hyperparameters-using-a-genetic-algorithm
This paper implements a hyperparameter optimization process using a genetic algorithm to automatically optimize the hyperparameters of three different neural network architectures. All models are trained on the same dataset, load_wine() from the sklearn library [Link to the project](https://github.com/deberdeev/Optimization-of-hyperparameters-using-a-genetic-algorithm) 

***Stack:*** Python, keras, sklearn
